# Orinoco

This is Project 5 of the Junior Web Developer path.

### Prerequisites

You will need to have Node and `npm` installed locally on your machine.

### Saas installation

From within the project folder, run `npm -g install sass`.
You can run sass with `npm run sass`.

### Autoprefixer installation

From within the project folder, run `npm install autoprefixer postcss postcss-cli -g`.
You can run autoprefixer with `npm run prefix`.

### Back end sever installation

Clone this repo. From the JWDP5 folder, run `npm install`. You
can then run the server with `node server`.
The server should run on `localhost` with default port `3000`. If the
server runs on another port for any reason, this is printed to the
console when the server starts, e.g. `Listening on port 3001`.
